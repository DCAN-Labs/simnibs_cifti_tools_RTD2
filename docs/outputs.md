## What is produced 
Once the run is completed, all the files will be saved in the folder you defined as output folder (in this example is /home/example1/PNRS). This folder will contain the following subfolders:

├── /home/example1  
    ├── BWAS
        └── tables
        ├── figures
            └── weights_explainedvariance
            ├── scatter_plots
               └── by_networks
            └── relativecontributions_plots
            └── pvalues_explainedvariance
            └── manhattan_plots
        └── ciftis
