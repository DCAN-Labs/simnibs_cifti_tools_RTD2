## What is produced 
Once the run is completed, all the files will be saved in the folder you defined as output folder (in this example is /home/example1/PNRS). This folder will contain the following subfolders:


├── /home/example1/
    ├── PNRS
        └── tables
            └── weights_explainedvariance
        └── figures
            └── weights_explainedvariance
            └── scores
            └── scatter_plots
                └── by_top_connection
                └── by_networks
            └── pvalues_explainedvariance_2_samples
            └── pvalues_explainedvariance
            └── explainedvariance_and_null
